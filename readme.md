This app can be used from expo's app on your phone (run 'npx expo start' from your terminal, then scan the QR code from your phone).

It is a mobile app made to save and store your to do lists and your wish lists.

The functionality is straightforward and simple. Click the '+' button to add a new chore or item to your wishlist. Both features start from the same button and will be chosen from a scroll menu.

I have not tested this app on an Android as I don't have access to one and the emulator will destory my ten year old computer (previously tested on another project), so I can guarentee any quality for Android phones.



As of now, it is not available on either of the app stores. (I can't believe apple requires 99USD a year just to upload an app!!)
